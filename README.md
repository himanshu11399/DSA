# My DSA Journey 🚀  

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository**! 👨‍💻  

I started my DSA journey with the goal of strengthening my problem-solving skills and building a solid foundation in computer science. Over time, I have explored various concepts, from **arrays and linked lists** to **graphs and dynamic programming**.  

### 🔹 What You’ll Find Here:  
- **Well-structured DSA implementations** in C++ and Python  
- **Optimized solutions** to popular coding problems  
- **Projects integrating DSA concepts**, such as:  
  - Student Record Management using Hashing  
  - Railway Reservation System with Priority Queue  
  - Flight Booking System with Quick Sort for price optimization  
  - Friend Recommendation System using BSTs and Graphs  

### 🔹 My Achievements So Far:  
✔ **LeetCode 50-day streak** 🏅  
✔ **CodeChef Gold Badge**  
✔ **Completed Linked List Module (Pro Certificate)**  
✔ **Participation in Hackathons** 🏆  

This repository is a reflection of my learning and growth in DSA. I continuously update it with new problems, concepts, and projects. If you're passionate about coding, feel free to explore, contribute, or discuss solutions! 🚀  

Happy Coding! 😊
